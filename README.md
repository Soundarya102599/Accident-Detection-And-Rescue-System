# Accident-Detection-And-Rescue-System
This project is based on after the detection of vehicle accident, the system automatically reports to the ambulance service and police station without any time loss so that the casualty might not lose his/her life due to late in rescue.The system is installed in the vehicle. As the preventive measures for vehicle accident the sensor like accelerometer is installed and for reporting GPS module and GSM module are used. Motor (control switch) is used for engine control and buzzer, led lights etc. are used for warning during prevention. All these devices are interfaced with the central microcontroller (Arduino Uno) unit.Accelerometer detects the occurrence of accident and sends signal to the microcontroller for further functioning. GPS module provides the location, speed, time and date of the certain place where the vehicle is in the real time. If accident occurs, the accelerometer detects it and location of accident is obtained using GPS, and finally sends the information to the
ambulance service and police by the help of GSM module.The message obtained in mobile phone consists of the location of the accidental place in the form of google map link which will help to the emergency units like ambulance service and police station to reach the casualty in time and rescue the lives.
